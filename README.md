# Coding-Optimizer-Macropad
There are many key commands I make repetitively while coding that require finger gymnastics. Can optimize this repetitive code by pasting the desired code block by block (on sequential button presses). The blocks are chunked by their ends lining up with the part of the code you need to customize.
