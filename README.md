# Coding-Optimizer-Macropad
There are many key commands I make repetitively while coding that require finger gymnastics. Can optimize this repetitive code by pasting the desired code block by block (on sequential button presses). The blocks are chunked by their ends lining up with the part of the code you need to customize.
Although using a macro pad requires you to leave home-row while writing code, I think the net benefit of not having to write boilerplate code repeatedly greatly outweighs the typing speed reduction.
